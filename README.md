## About
This project was for an applied research course at Tennessee Technical University in Spring 2022. Three senior Comp. Sci. majors within the Data Science concentration were assembled to compete in a Kaggle competition. Their task was to predict the functioning status of waterpoints in Tanzania. The dataset and guidelines were provided through the Kaggle website. With an ensemble approach, the group was able to reach nearly 80% prediction accuracy (the measure of success according to the competition).
